# EasyTame

My first Rune Factory 5 mod. This ensures that taming always succeeds, provided you have room for the monster. Because I want 8 buffamoo damn it.

I wanted to replay RF5 on my TV with my Stadia controller using my Steam Deck. This led me to the popular [RF5Fix mod](https://github.com/Lyall/RF5Fix).
That forced my choice of BepInEx 6, which results in many of the mods on NexusMods not working (they're designed for BepInEx 5). In particular,
it meant I couldn't use [Taming Always Succeeds](https://www.nexusmods.com/runefactory5/mods/14). Luckily both of those mods are open source and fairly
simple, so I took a bit from each and got this.
